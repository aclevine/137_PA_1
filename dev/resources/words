not sure that it s right for us to invite the president of russia to mediate this dispute there because we might not like the result that comes out of that gore said on friday bush criticized his opponent s statement either he didn't know what the president was doing or he did know what the president was doing and wasn't willing to share that with the american people bush said in florida where

welcomed yugoslavia s change saying it brings the country back into the community of nations he added this is a day for celebration without commenting on the russian issue the white house however came to his defense what the vice president said is something the president fully agrees with which is that the united states did not support any role in which russia would mediate between milosevic and kostunica said presidential spokesman jake siewert who confirmed that clinton spoke with putin about yugoslavia last weekend the dispute over a foreign policy matter comes late in a campaign that has given little attention to most offshore issues what discussion there has been has tended to involve a contrast in plans for the military bush decries the state of the military and calls for more-limited engagement abroad gore defends current military readiness and urges a definition of national security interests that would include environmental health and other global issues the

sleeping bags and scattered cans of food litter the muddy floor and the walls are charred black from fire but the stone sarcophagus is untouched perhaps the one object still respected at this holy site revered by some as the burial place of the biblical patriarch the compound was home to a jewish seminary where about 30 students would study during the day the israeli army evacuated the outpost before dawn on saturday after clashes there last week killed six palestinians and an israeli border policeman the seminary had been closed during the violence palestinian security officials were left standing guard as hundreds of palestinians converged on the square in front of the site cheering the withdrawal with the arrival of dozens of palestinian gunmen the celebration degenerated into a

tomb with his friends nablus gov mahmoud aloul came to the square to plead with the vandals to stop we should protect this building and make it a symbol for our martyrs who were killed defending it

spokesman nahman shai he said the government deeply deplores the trashing of the tomb a statement by the 15 member european union also condemned the destruction the tomb s holiness is disputed as tradition holds that joseph was actually buried in egypt the connection of the site to joseph is a relatively recent local arab tradition also observed by some jews what i want to understand is if joseph is not buried there why this place was so important said abdul fateh sayed 62 whose bookstore across the street was hit by stray bullets in the fighting now it s over we are very happy he said

djindjic head of the democratic party told the associated press after initial speculation that he was hiding out a visibly shaken milosevic appeared on tv late friday to concede defeat and

legislature of serbia yugoslavia s dominant republic where they are allied with the ultranationalist radical party the president of serbia milan milutinovic is one of milosevic s closest cronies he is also an indicted war criminal and his fate depends on milosevic s own political survival the serbian presidency has sweeping powers including direct control over the state s 100,000-strong police force its powers are much more substantial than those of the federal president even though milosevic beefed up the post s stature under his tenure milutinovic occupies a very strong post and he will remain unswervingly loyal to milosevic said braca grubacic a belgrade political analyst this presents milosevic with unlimited possibilities to block any reforms initiated by kostunica even on the federal level milosevic retains significant clout his leftist coalition controls 46 of 178 seats in the federal parliament together with an allied party from montenegro yugoslavia s smaller republic his allies could conceivably form the new federal government sidelining kostunica ultimately however milosevic s ability to play any political role will depend on his ability to rally his badly shaken party stunned by the extent of their electoral defeat members were reported to be deserting in droves some opposition leaders are convinced milosevic s power will ebb quickly now that he has lost control of the government media he used as his propaganda mouthpiece during 13 years of iron-fisted rule milosevic also remains vulnerable to criminal prosecution for running one of europe s most corrupt regimes some have accused him of orchestrating a spate of assassinations in which some of the country s most senior politicians and underworld figures have died in the end milosevic may even

marked the 13 years of milosevic s rule everything is peaceful he said yugoslavia and serbia have joined the family of democratic nations still discord could resurface at least in parliament the swearing-in itself was repeatedly delayed by milosevic allies who contested parts of the sept 24 vote and with kostunica s 18-party opposition block short of an absolute majority it appears compelled to deal with the socialist people's party of montenegro the smaller yugoslav republic that party backed milosevic until his downfall and now seeks to have one of its own appointed as yugoslavia s

that has broken the camel s back gelbard was not available for comment monday but in the past has maintained that the united states still strongly supports democratic reforms in indonesia anwar and

fees frankfurt germany ap computer giant hewlett-packard corp has become the first company to be snagged by a german law requiring firms to pay fees for making cd burners that are being used to illegally lift the latest hits off the world wide web the case sets the stage for other european countries to possibly adopt similar rules to stem an epidemic that cost the music industry an estimated 5 billion last year but analysts blasted the agreement reached thursday as another example of germany s notorious thatch of regulations the manufacturers are scapegoats said robert labatt a new media analyst at research group gartner it s the individual works of art books songs videos that need to be protected many of germany s neighbors including france italy and greece have similar laws meant to protect authors and musicians by nailing makers of equipment used to violate copyright laws but the laws date back decades and focus on devices like tape recorders and video players the german case against hewlett-packard extends germany s pre-existing law into the digital age when such things as cd burners computer printers hard drives and high-speed modems make it easier to copy and transfer copyrighted items according to the international federation of the phonographic industry about 500 million cds are pirated annually by people creating their own cds from downloaded tunes off the internet more than 25 million pirated music files are available online the group estimates all told that racked up a 1 billion for europe s 10 billion music industry last year and cost eu governments around 72 million in lost tax revenues the group says several lawsuits have been filed around the world including an ongoing lawsuit a number of record companies have brought against napster inc whose software allows users to easily swap music files gema german s main licensing group targeted hewlett-packard as a test case in may reasoning that the company leads the german market leader in cd burners but hewlett-packard dug in its heels when it was ordered to pay 30 marks 12.90 for each cd burner sold in germany since february 1998 the legal battle continued until thursday when an agreement was reached to have hewlett-packard pay 3.60 marks 1.54 for each unit sold during that period while agreeing to pay 12 marks 5.16 for each one sold in the future hewlett-packard spokeswoman jeannette weisschuh refused to say how much that would set the company back but she criticized the settlement for putting hewlett-packard at a disadvantage against foreign online retailers who unburdened by such fees can sell cheaper cd burners this was a trial to set an example for the whole market said weisschuh it s unfair to the consumers who have to pay more and unfair to the manufacturers because it gives us a competitive disadvantage other companies selling cd burners in germany will also be subject to the fees which could vary depending on what kind of agreement they reach with gema the hewlett-packard settlement is expected to set a benchmark however currently equipment manufacturers pay 2.50 marks 1.07 for each cassette recorder and 18 marks 7.74 for each video recorder sold in germany the fees which are not collected by the government are distributed by gema to copyright owners through recording houses and music distributors apw20001126.1818.0460 news story

dinosaurs some experts say but others disagree two chinese researchers report that a fossil called protopteryx from a group of flying animals called enantiornithine includes feathers that are different from those of all other known fossil and modern feathers fucheng zhang and zhonghe zhou of the chinese academy of sciences suggest in the journal science that the discovery supports the idea that feathers evolved from scales like those found in reptiles the study was to be published friday some researchers who oppose the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs embraced the new fossil as proof that birds and dinosaurs evolved independently from a common reptilian ancestor but others say protopteryx adds nothing to the dino-bird debate there is nothing in the skeleton of this bird that disputes the dinosaur origin of birds said thomas r holtz jr a university of maryland paleobiologist and specialists on bird evolution the fact that this protopteryx has these weird flat feathers really doesn't affect that issue alan feduccia an evolutionary biologist at the university of north carolina said the chinese study of protopteryx is a hot paper that directly contradicts the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs the new fossil was unveiled the day after researchers announced that another ancient chinese bird called microraptor zhaoianus supported the dinosaur origin of birds in the study zhang and zhou described the feather and bone structure found in a fossil of a starling-sized bird uncovered in northern china the site of many dinosaur fossil finds the chinese researchers said the feathers have some of the characteristics of modern feathers but the structure is more primitive than feathers found on archaeopteryx the earliest known bird archaeopteryx appeared about 145 million years ago while protopteryx was dated as more recent about 120 million years ago microraptor which was about the size of a crow lived about 125 million years ago some elements of the protopteryx wing bone and muscle structure match those of modern birds said zhang and zhou but the wing retains a claw found on some primitive birdlike animals in modern birds that claw has disappeared and been replaced with a structure that adds lift to the wing nonetheless protopteryx is thought to have been a competent flier most dinosaur researchers believe birds evolved 150 to 180 million years ago from a dinosaur group called theropods researchers cite fundamental skeleton similarities to support the theory the evolution of feathers however has been less clear some experts believe feathers evolved specifically to support flight while others say feathers evolved first to provide warmth or protection from water fossils of three theropods bear hairlike images that some say could be the early precursors to feathers but feduccia dismisses the theropod hair as dino fuzz and cites the zhang and zhou paper as proof that feathers evolved from reptilian scales and that this could mean that birds evolved independent of dinosaurs bird feathers are very closely related to scales said feduccia it is clear they evolved from elongated scales dino fuzz has nothing to do with feathers larry martin a university of kansas paleontologist said the chinese researchers paper is the strongest evidence yet that bird feathers evolved for flight and that they were derived from scales holtz however notes that protopteryx with its primitive feathers lived millions of years after archaeopteryx which had feathers almost identical to those of modern birds this means the feathers on protopteryx were probably an evolutionary reversal said holtz adding that there are many examples where such reversals occur in nature this just shows that feathers are extremely adaptable structures he said michael novacek a dinosaur expert at the american museum of natural history in new york says that the zhang and zhou study is ambiguous on the issue of dinosaurs and birds the fact that you see a resemblance between scales and feathers doesn't eliminate dinosaurs as close relatives to birds said novacek he too said that evolution reversals are not rare he said for example that whale ancestors lived on land and had fur but evolution carried the huge mammals back to the sea holtz said the zhang and zhou study is important because it adds new understanding about the enantiornithine a bird group that dominated the latter part of the age of dinosaurs the enantiornithine got clobbered in the extinction event that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago he said this was followed by the dominance of another bird group the ornithurae which later evolved into modern birds said holtz on the net science journal http://www.eurekalert.org dinosaurs

former president boris yeltsin has joined other critics of the move to restore the anthem he said in an interview published friday in the daily komsomolskaya pravda that the solemn music recalls communist party congresses not soviet sports victories and achievements in space as putin had said i m categorically against the restoration of the soviet anthem yeltsin said communists and other hard-liners had opposed the tricolor flag and the eagle as a vestige of the czars forcing yeltsin to approve them by decree but they agreed to abandon their criticism and back formal approval for the symbols in response to the reintroduction of the soviet anthem no conclusive version of new lyrics for the old music has been approved yet the duma asked putin to set up a panel to consider the text

secondhand smoke during flights to asia the court on a 6-3 vote monday declined to hear northwest s appeal that argued the lawsuit was pre-empted by the federal law that deregulated the airline industry voting to grant review were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day o'connor and clarence thomas writing for the three o'connor said the case presents an important issue that has divided federal appeals courts and should be resolved by the nation s highest court the case was filed by julie duncan of seattle who said she suffered lung problems and chronic infections apparently related to secondhand smoke northwest prohibited smoking on domestic flights in 1988 before the ban was required by federal law but continued to allow smoking on flights to and from japan for another decade the airline said it did so to compete with other airlines that let passengers smoke duncan s lawsuit which sought class-action status said northwest violated its duty under washington state law to provide a safe and healthy working environment the 1978 airline deregulation act pre-empts all state lawsuits related to airline rates routes or services a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit saying that allowing duncan s claim to proceed would amount to allowing state regulation of a service provided by northwest on its trans pacific flights but the 9th u.s circuit court of appeals reinstated duncan s lawsuit last april allowing smoking on some flights is not a service provided by an airline the court said the court also said the prospect of damages from a personal-injury lawsuit would not affect an airline s services enough to warrant pre-emption under the federal law in the appeal acted on monday northwest s lawyers said airlines should not have to

soc-mls-lawsuit major league soccer wins lawsuit boston ap major league soccer scored a victory over its players on monday when a jury decided that the league was not a monopoly with the power to depress salaries the class-action antitrust lawsuit filed in federal court claimed that mls owners conspired with the u.s soccer federation to eliminate competition for division i soccer players but after about a day of deliberation the jury found that plenty of competition existed in europe in latin america and in minor and indoor leagues in the united states we couldn't have told the players take it or leave it because they had other places to go said michael cardozo an attorney for mls the players will appeal the verdict attorney jeffrey kessler said jurors told the associated press that they were impressed by the testimony of former deputy commissioner sunil gulati who compiled a chart noting that mls players had come from and gone to professional leagues in dozens of other countries but the players argued that only 20 percent of mls players had international options others were turned away because of visa and work-permit requirements or other limits on the use of foreign players all we want is an agreement between labor and management said garth lagerway the miami fusion goalkeeper and player representative all that s happened in the history of this league is the league telling us what we had to accept because the jury sided with the owners that the market was not limited to division i soccer in this country it did not have to answer any of the other questions at the heart of the players case was the claim that if not for the exclusion of other division i leagues there could be a thriving marketplace for soccer leagues and players in this country however the jury found that two topflight leagues would oversaturate the limited american interest in the sport it was our feeling that if these two leagues had been in place both would be bankrupt juror tina hart told the ap there isn't enough demand for it mls owners claimed that they have lost 250 million since 1995 even without competition a decision against them would have been tripled under antitrust law and then applied to other players in the class which could have put it into the tens of millions of dollars the case had been closely watched at the start when players claimed that the single-entity structure of the league a centralized ownership mimicked by every new sports league formed since mls was itself an antitrust violation that claim was thrown out before trial kessler said it would be appealed along with this jury s verdict but monday s decision is a setback for the players in that case as well the league has argued that the jury s definition of the market will apply to and

in the 1980s but the reality is if i use the better product i get less functionality for this reason instant messaging rivals like microsoft at&amp;t and exciteathome maintain their users ought to be able to send messages to anyone else regardless of what service they happen to have that s not currently possible the companies are lobbying the federal communications commission to require aol to make its product compatible with those offered by competitors as a condition of its merger with time warner so far the agency appears to favor a more tailored approach the commission s staff has recommended that aol be required to make its system work with at least one other provider but the requirement would apply only to advanced instant messaging services offered over time warner s cable lines how the agency defines advanced services is unclear they could refer to features beyond text messaging such as video teleconferencing the sharing of files or messaging over interactive television today consumers more commonly take advantage of the garden variety functions they type short real-time phrases to others allowing them to chat back-and-forth using text unlike e-mail it's instantaneous and gets the recipient s attention right away people can communicate with international friends without the hefty phone bills and the service has taken hold with those who have hearing or speech disabilities unlike the telephone people can discreetly interact with others or decide not to it s communications that can be ignored said jonathan sacks a vice president at aol which runs the two leading messaging services icq and aim with 140 million users on the telephone you can't see when somebody is near the phone you can't see when it's convenient for them to communicate with you aol rivals say that if instant messaging is to be as ubiquitous as the phone network it has to work the same way people who use different providers must still be able to contact one another they continue to lobby the fcc hoping to see the conditions broadened before the agency issues its final decision it s really important to get this right before innovation is squashed because one company has a monopoly said jon englund vice president of government affairs for exciteathome it's absolutely critical that internet uses have real choice among competing platforms aol has said it wants to work toward interoperability but first needs to protect consumer privacy and security to prevent the kinds of problems that have emerged in the e-mail world like spamming unwanted junk messages company officials disagreed that aol s market share was keeping out competitors aol executives cited a recent study by media metrix indicating that the messaging services offered by yahoo and microsoft are the fastest growing in the united states why all the fuss over a free product that anyone even those who don't subscribe to aol can use some pointed to the recent demise of two instant messaging competitors icast and tribal voice as evidence that aol s dominance could prevent choices in the market another concern is that aol could use its substantial customer base to tack on new advanced services and then charge for them rivals said the ability of various services to work together will become increasingly important in the future for example as instant messaging migrates to cell phones or hand-held computer organizers consumers won't want to have to install multiple services on these devices said brian park senior product for yahoo communications services you can have

and an invading one appeared in prime spawning areas just as breeding season for many of the gulf s most important species kicked into high gear according to the national marine fisheries service the number of jellyfish in the gulf has been rising for at least 13 years scientists say the jellyfish are exploiting three major human induced changes in the environment thousands of oil rigs and artificial reefs established to attract game fish have greatly increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish which need a hard surface for spawning nitrogen pollution from farm runoff and industrial sources feeds plankton blooms providing extra food for jellyfish and commercial fishermen take great numbers of menhaden a soft-finned bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the plankton dr monty graham a researcher at the dauphin island sea lab in alabama worries that with all these advantages jellyfish cannot help but multiply at an astonishing rate making matters much worse he said is the advent of phyllorhiza punctata or australian spotted jellyfish the giant species previously unreported in the gulf is a 25-pound bruiser of a jellyfish native to the pacific some time ago the basketball-size jellyfish established themselves in the caribbean this summer after apparently riding ocean currents north they concentrated themselves in the passes between the barrier islands that separate the mississippi sound from the gulf of mexico the australian jellyfish have now mostly died off in the gulf but fishery scientists worry that they may already have affected next year s fish

speckled trout white trout and spanish mackerel as well as commercially important species like crabs and menhaden spawn just outside the barrier islands this year their eggs and larvae had to drift with tidal currents through the jellyfish-choked passes to reach the estuaries that serve as nurseries for the baby fish these things are incredibly efficient at turning the water over cleaning it of everything in it graham said we re finding them with 200 fish eggs in their guts the newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that involved swimming to the surface then diving down to the bottom scouring the water of virtually every living thing smaller than a bb pellet after flowing through the jellyfish gantlet scientists said the water was almost devoid of living things you really have two problems in terms of commercially important fish said harriet m perry director of the fisheries section of the gulf coast research laboratory in mississippi first the jellies are ingesting the larvae and eggs of these commercially important species and then the fish larvae must compete with these incredibly efficient jellies for the same food source perry said she worried that the phyllorhiza might become permanent residents graham said he feared that their offspring might appear in larger numbers next spring he noted though that the newcomers represented a small threat

that up to him chapman s pursuit of publicity occupied much of the discussion despite his professed wish to return to the anonymity that had plagued him as a security guard in hawaii enough to make him commit his notorious crime when the board denied parole in a written statement issued shortly after the hearing it said your most vicious and violent act was apparently fueled by your need to be acknowledged during your parole hearing this panel noted your continued interest in maintaining your notoriety asked what he had done to attract attention since he was incarcerated chapman recalled a

the stock market in israel fell 16 percent in egypt the market dropped 20 percent but for most american investors many of whom buy their stocks through mutual funds the impact was more diffuse though still strong while few investors own funds containing many middle eastern companies partly because there are not that many around to buy they nonetheless felt the effects of the region s volatility wall street and other global markets were concerned that the violence would translate into higher oil prices which it did briefly and that those prices in turn could lead to inflation and higher interest rates that line of thinking played a big role in the 379-point drop in the dow jones industrial average and the 93-point drop in the nasdaq composite index on oct 12 the day that a palestinian mob mauled two israeli soldiers israel retaliated with rocket attacks and terrorists blew a hole in a united states warship in yemen last week israeli and palestinian leaders agreed to the

companies yet the trouble in the region was among several factors along with a general sell-off in technology and telecommunications stocks that brought down prices emerging-markets funds declined

investments in the region are still relatively small usually less than 10 percent of the portfolios most of the markets in the middle east are insignificant in terms of the amount of capital invested in them from the united states said mark madden manager of the 250 million pioneer emerging markets fund madden invests mainly in mexico brazil and korea about 5 percent of his portfolio is in israel

catholic church official to broach a topic considered taboo at the vatican but he is the highest-ranking leader to address the question so openly the vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls issued a terse reaction saying this is the personal opinion of cardinal danneels that we do not confirm the cardinal spoke in answer to a question in an interview included in his book frankly speaking six conversations with the cardinal speculation that john paul might step down if his health deteriorates to the extent that he cannot fulfill his duties has echoed around the church ever since he turned 75 the mandatory retirement age for bishops in 1995 the rumors grew louder as the pope visibly weakened and this year passed his 80th birthday the age at which cardinals become ineligible to vote in a conclave for the next pope in january bishop karl lehmann leader of the german bishops conference unleashed a flurry of articles in the italian press when he told a questioner on german radio that he believed that the pope would resign for the good of the church if he felt he could not fulfill his papal functions the pope whose speech is slurred and who shakes badly because of a neurological disorder has nevertheless marshaled his strength to preside over this year s jubilee a holy year of the church once the holy year ends on jan 6 however many wonder whether he might retire the pope has not addressed the issue directly but his few comments on the subject suggest that he is determined to serve out his full term on his 75th birthday he told an audience of pilgrims at st peter's referring to god i leave it to him to decide when and how he wants to relieve me of this service the pope keeps up a full schedule and the vatican says he wants to make other important trips in 2001 there is no detailed procedure for a papal resignation and little precedent the last pope to resign voluntarily was celestine v in 1294 but canon law does allow a pope to resign saying it is valid as long as the pope does it freely there are no explicit instructions on how the vatican should function if a pope had a stroke or went into a coma and could not express his wishes the rev thomas j reese an american jesuit who wrote a book on vatican procedure inside the vatican the politics and organization of the catholic church said the real problem is if the pope can no longer govern and is incapable of resigning some reform-minded catholics believe that it would be healthier for the church if popes resigned when their health failed traditionalists reject all talk of papal resignations

series of attacks by the democrats on bush s five years in office while the party appears to be counting largely on local news outlets to convey the video s message to voters the democratic party has also been running commercials in cities like seattle des moines iowa and tampa fla to attack the governor s handling of issues of local concern the latest spots by the bush campaign and the republican party meanwhile take a much softer tack in fact two new bush commercials that began running monday in many swing states merely reiterate the governor s thoughts and ideas about education an issue he has promoted on television since the new hampshire primary parents need tools to help them protect and nurture their families bush says in one of the new spots in the other he says how come the hard things don't get done because they're hard if we want to make sure no child gets left behind in america we need the courage to do some tough things the democrats continuing emphasis on bush s home-state record is a reflection of a strategy of attack that has been tried in all recent elections against sitting or former governors who secure their party nomination for president in the last 25 years political analysts say the tactic has succeeded only once when then-vice president george bush famously disparaged michael s dukakis record in massachusetts on pollution in boston harbor and shortcomings in a state prison furlough program every time a governor runs the opponent attacks his record but three out of the last four times the governor has won darrell west a political science professor at brown university who analyzes campaign advertising said of similar attacks faced by jimmy carter ronald reagan and bill clinton the sharp critiques issued by the gore campaign and its supporters west said have placed the democrats in an unconventional position there s been a role reversal in this election because typically the challenger goes on attack and the incumbent stays above the fray he observed and here you have gore playing the challenger role in its new video the democratic national committee interviews several texans with complaints about what they say are the bush administration s neglectful attitudes about their problems one segment features the destitute hamlets or colonias that are home to some of the poorest texans governor bush has never visited a colonia so to the extent that that shows how much of a priority it is for him may the american public decide a former colonia resident comments the bush campaign took issue with that assertion declaring in a statement that the governor had visited colonias three times while inspecting flood damage and being briefed on water and sewage problems some of the video s interviewees have been seen on television

quarter and 40 percent earnings growth in 2001 analysts were pleased if not completely persuaded by the positive report while compaq reported strong overall growth in its server business several observers noted that the 5 percent growth in the unix server segment was well below the industry average similarly the 9 percent growth in the data storage business was an improvement on past quarters
